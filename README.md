<h2>Game Description</h2>

A young boy, Sam, is awoken in the middle of the night by the crack of thunder when his fear of darkness begins to take over. He grabs the flashlight next to his bed to help navigate to the lightswitch at the end of his dark room but fumbles the light as he turns it on. As Sam stands in the beaming light, he turns to look at his own shadow on the wall when suddenly his imagination runs wild and his shadow comes to life. He now realizes that he can work with his shadow to conquer to night and reach heights he never could before.
